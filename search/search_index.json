Project Overview E-commerce has been rising rapidly in popularity. The way we shop has changed. Everyone used to have to go to retail stores in order to shop for things. E-commerce allows shopping with a single push of a button. During its rise, online clothing stores started popping up, initially not being as popular. During the recent pandemic, online clothing stores were the only option. One by one, more and more clothing stores appeared. Small businesses, huge businesses all joined in. In some countries, they end up being the new normal. Even with this industry rapidly gaining popularity, there\u2019s still one thing that makes old school shopping better. Trying on clothes. Not being able to try on the clothes is the worst thing about clothes shopping online. Sizing could be off, might not look good on you, and several other reasons. Some of us do not have the time to be able to drive from place to place to find the right shirt, to queue in the monstrous long lines of the dressing room, the money to spend on gas driving back and forth. Our aim with this project is to allow everyone to be able to try on clothes from wherever they are. Eliminating that feeling of unsureness before spending their savings on clothes they might or might not like. And even when they are not purchasing, just to have fun trying on different outfits.

However, this process can be time\u2011consuming, inconve\u2011 nient, and limited by factors such as store availability and fitting room spaces. The concept of a virtual dressing room software stems from the desire to provide users with a convenient and immersive way to try on different outfits without physically wearing them. This technology has gained popularity in recent years due to advancements in computer vision, augmented reality, and e\u2011commerce. Outline The objective of this software is to design an online virtual dressing room application that allows users to try on different outfits virtually. The key requirements for this software are as follows: Image Capture: The software should be able to capture user images using the device's camera or webcam. Intelligent Face Replacement: The captured image should be processed to replace the user's head with a chosen outfit's image intelligently. Outfit Selection and Styling: The application should provide users with the ability to choose from a variety of clothing styles and outfits. Quick Outfit Change: Users should be able to easily switch between different outfits with ac\u2011 ceptable delay. Fast Display of Outfit Images: The software should efficiently display the selected outfit images on the user's face within the dressing room. Easy Navigation of Outfit Combinations: Users should be able to quickly browse through various clothing combinations and view outfit images. Clothing Categorization and Recommendations: The application should have a built\u2011in feature that categorizes clothing items and provides recommendations based on user preferences.
