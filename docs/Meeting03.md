### Topic

* Progress update
* Discussion about the possible solutions of the software

### Participants

* Attendance:
*Qian Zhang* (supervisor), Zheyuan Jiang,  Zhikai Hu, Chenglong Xia, Xingze Liu, Tan Yee Yang, Elkin Agilroy KRISTAN
* Absence: *NONE*

### Meeting Record

* Algorithms recommended:
  * faceswapping
  * diffusion model: generate real picture(based on command/ input image)
* About *3D model creating*
  * hardware requirements: 4080 GPU, large disk
  * how to create the database that includes abundant(tes and thousands of)
* *Distribution of software* the process of delivering software to the end user
* <u>**Qian's advice**</u>: spend more time on the software designing, not the algorithm
  * 2D solution
  * using api
  * Possible solution: 3D & 2D
    * 2D: diffusion using 2D model,just try on
    * 3D using just the normalized avatar and dress
  * face swapping in 2D, how to resolve it to 3D and the time consumption for the process(15ms preferred)**test the time or the API to generate the model, and the *lack* issue**
